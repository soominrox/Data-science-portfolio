Hello visitors!
This is a repository containing portfolio of data science projects completed by me for academic, self-learning and hobby purposes.

# Contents
- Machine Learning 
  - Bike Sharing Demand Dataset: A model to predict the total count of bikes rented during each hour using various statistical analysis tools. (random forest regressor)
  (- New York Stock Exchange dataset: Predicting stock prices using RNN, LSTM, and ARIMA model) (Being edited at the moment)
  - Lezhin Comics Data Challenge 2017: Analyzing a dataset to assist making better marketing decisions.
  - Predicting Boston Housing Prices: A model to predict the value of a given house in the Boston real estate market using various statistical analysis tools. Identified the best price that a client can sell their house utilizing machine learning. 
  - Deep learning: Image Classification / Recognition using MNIST dataset 
  - Google Play Store Dataset: Analyzing the dataset by visualizing with Seaborn and came up with a model which predicts the ratings of each game.
